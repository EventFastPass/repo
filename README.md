# Welcome!

We are students of CyberSecurity at TAFE-NSW and this repository is dedicated to our group project.
Group Members:  Calvin Cheng - Julian Arias - Murilo de Grandi - Sergio Gomes

This repository stores Python codes used to create an Identity verification and authentication system that can be used in venues that require strict access control. Multiple AWS technologies such as AWS Rekognition, AWS Lambda, Amazon SNS, Amazon S3 and Amazon Lightsail have been used to create the system, which is also linked to the website https://eventfastpass.link.

Demonstration is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oARh76ubNCY 

If you have any questions/sugestions or feedback, please contact us on facerecog22@gmail.com.

Hope you enjoy it!
